## Introduction

SunEnergyXT 500 Series is a custom integration for Home Assistant. It lets you discover, monitor, and control SunEnergyXT 500 Series AIO devices over the local network.

For the complete local API field reference, `MD` meter connection string examples, and `TZ` timezone examples, see [API.md](API.md).

## Features

- Discover devices automatically via Zeroconf, or add a device manually by IP address
- Monitor PV input, grid port power, load port power, battery level, firmware versions, and other real-time data
- Adjust common settings such as `GS`, `IS`, `SI`, `SA`, `SO`, and `PT`
- Configure Local Mode, `MM` Local Self-Consumption Mode, `MD` local meter connection settings, and the `TZ` timezone field
- **Automatic GS control via any Home Assistant sensor** — no dedicated smart meter at the device required
- Restart the device from Home Assistant

## Installation

### Install via HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click the three dots in the top right corner and select "Custom repositories"
3. Enter the repository address: https://github.com/SunEnergyXT/SunEnergyXT-500-Series
4. Select "Integration" as the category
5. Click "Add"
6. Search for "SunEnergyXT 500 Series"
7. Click "Download"
8. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest [release package](https://github.com/SunEnergyXT/SunEnergyXT-500-Series/releases)
2. Extract it to the `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Make sure the final directory is `config/custom_components/sunenergyxt/`
4. Restart Home Assistant

```

## Configuration

1. In Home Assistant, go to "Settings" > "Devices & services"
2. Click "Add Integration"
3. Search for `SunEnergyXT 500 Series`
4. Follow the setup prompts
   - If the device is discovered automatically, confirm the discovered device
   - If the device is not discovered automatically, enter the device IP address manually
5. The integration reads the device SN and model automatically. You do not need to enter the SN manually
6. **Optional:** Select a Home Assistant sensor as the grid power source (see next section)

Usage notes:

- Home Assistant and the device must be on the same local network
- If you rely on automatic discovery, make sure the network allows mDNS / Zeroconf traffic
- After changing a control item, wait for the next polling cycle or read the status again to confirm the final value

## Automatic GS Control via HA Sensor

The integration supports optional, hardware-independent control of the grid power setpoint (`GS`) using any Home Assistant power sensor.

### Why is this useful?

By default, the device's local self-consumption mode (`MM`) only supports specific meters directly (Shelly Pro 3EM, EcoTracker, Tasmota/BitShake). Users with other energy meters — such as **SolarEdge Modbus**, **Tibber Pulse**, **Volkszähler**, or any other integration — can use their existing HA sensor directly. No additional hardware at the storage device is required.

### Setup

In the final step of the setup dialog, an optional entity selector appears:

> **Grid Power Sensor (optional)**
> Select a Home Assistant sensor that provides the current grid power in Watts.

Select the sensor that measures the current grid power at your home connection point. The field can be left empty — in that case the behaviour is unchanged from the original.

### Sign Convention

The sign convention of the selected sensor must match the device API:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Positive** | Export to grid (feed-in / surplus) |
| **Negative** | Import from grid (consumption) |

> **Note:** Check the sign of your sensor before configuring. Many integrations (e.g. SolarEdge Modbus Multi) already deliver grid power in this convention.

### Behaviour after configuration

- On every state change of the sensor, the integration automatically writes the new `GS` value to the device
- Fluctuations below 10 W are ignored (deadband) to prevent unnecessary writes
- Values are rounded to 10 W (device step size)
- The sensor is optional — without configuration, `GS` can still be set manually via the Number entity
- No `rest_command` in `configuration.yaml` required

### Compatible sensor examples

| Source | Typical entity ID |
|--------|-------------------|
| SolarEdge Modbus Multi (HACS) | `sensor.solaredge_meter_power` |
| Shelly Pro 3EM | `sensor.shelly_pro3em_total_active_power` |
| Tibber Pulse | `sensor.tibber_power` |
| Volkszähler / SML | depends on integration |
| ESPHome (IR reader) | depends on configuration |

## Entity Description

Notes:

- The actual visible entities may vary by model, firmware version, and the number of expansion storages
- Energy counters are usually reported by the device as raw `Wh`; this integration displays them as `kWh`
- `TZ` must be a POSIX timezone string, not a country, city, or short label such as `CEST`

## Troubleshooting

### Device Not Found

- Make sure the device is powered on and connected to the local network
- Make sure Home Assistant and the device are on the same network segment
- If automatic discovery fails, enter the device IP address manually
- If the network blocks mDNS / Zeroconf traffic, automatic discovery may not work

### Data Update Issues

- Check whether the device network connection is stable
- Check whether `http://device-ip/read` is reachable directly
- After changing a control item, confirm the final result by reading the device state again

### GS Is Not Written Automatically

- Check that the configured sensor provides a numeric value in Watts
- Check whether the sensor state is `unavailable` or `unknown`
- Verify the sign convention: positive = feed-in, negative = import
- Check the HA logs for errors from the integration (`Logger: custom_components.sunenergyxt`)

### Local Self-Consumption Mode Does Not Work

- Make sure `MD` follows the exact meter-type example shown in [API.md](API.md)
- Make sure `MM` is enabled
- Check whether `MS` reports an online meter status and whether live meter data is updating
- Do not rely on `MD` itself as a guaranteed echo after writing

### Timezone Setting Is Incorrect

- `TZ` must be a POSIX timezone string
- Do not enter `Europe/Berlin`, `UTC+1`, `CET`, or `CEST` as the final `TZ` value
- For Germany, use a DST-aware POSIX string such as `CET-1CEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3`
- After changing `TZ`, confirm the resulting timezone behavior instead of expecting the exact written value to be echoed back
